Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

Which methods did you decide to overload, and why?
I decided to overload the subclass constructors for the house and library sub classes because people might only enter part of the information of houses/libraries (for example, forget to provide information about elevator or didn't provide active location). For the cafe subclass, I overloaded restock method because a cafe may want to restock different inventories. For example, a cafee house is more likely to run out of cafe than creamers and sugarpackages. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
The overloading and overriding methods worked. And through working on the campus map, I have a better idea of association. One thing that didn't work at first place was active location, and it couldn't be updated from parent class and return back to child class. I ended up overloaded building class constructor with actice floor as a parameter and use super to extend active floor. Then the program works.
